## 1.0.2

* Be more explicit about `JsonDocumentTransformer`'s error-handling behavior.

## 1.0.1

* Fix `MultiChannel`'s constructor to take a `StreamChannel`. This is
  technically a breaking change, but since 1.0.0 was only released an hour ago,
  we're treating it as a bug fix.

## 1.0.0

* Initial version
